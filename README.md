## My Contributions to this project

For this project, I worked on the funcitonality for the app:

1. creating the firebase database backend to store the events info
2. setting up the form in our app so the user can upload their event and save it to our database
3. retriving the JSOn data from firebase and rendering it with a related giphyAPI gif as background
4. gathering user selections and funneling them into other components to render results
5. general problem solving during development


## Not So Social

Dinner dates, bachelor parties, prom nights, and game nights. These social events are fantastic, but think about the mess, expensive outings, and rowdy crowd. Hard pass. Why not fill the time with some great TV shows during these social events in the comfort of your own home with or without a crowd.
